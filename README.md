CMD-Chart

<img width="100%" src="demo.gif">

Tiny library for charting histograms on the command-line, written in and for nodejs.

## Chart types

Only histograms are supported, as this is what I was working with when I got distracted.


## Documentation

Yes.

Soon. Once I finish the work I was supposed to be doing.

Check the demo file, meanwhile.
